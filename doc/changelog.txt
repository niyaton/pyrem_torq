Pyremics Torq changelog
===========================

Known Bugs
  - None.

0.4 2011/09/13
  - Dropped pyrem_torq.expression_shortname.
  - Renamed some classes: Req -> Require, Xcp -> RequireBut, XcpThenAny -> AnyBut.
  - Renamed Marker -> Holder. Its constructor now doesn't require the name.
  - Dropped ExprDict.
  - Specification change: a function pyrem_torq.script.compile() now requires all 
    replacements "filled" with argument replaces. For each "@name" in parameter src, 
    replaces["name"] must returns a valid TorqExpression object. Otherwise, the 
    function raise a KeyError.
  - Dropped a method build() from TorqExpression and its descendant classes. 
    (The build() methods did two jobs, factory and optimizer, so confusing as API.)
  - Added a method optimized() to TorqExpression and its descendant classes. 
    (optimized() methods have been split from the old build() methods.)

0.3 2010/03/11
  - Changed module name from pytorqy to pyrem_torq.
  - Added an experimental feature, operator_builder.
  - Revised grammar.

0.2 2010/02/22
  - Changed internal data structures for optimization.

0.1 2009/12/17
